Let's learn some faces, shall we?

* `npm install` to get started
* `gulp` to start watching less files
* `npm test` to run test files
* `npm start` to launch nodemon


# TODO

#### DEV
* install bootstrap via bower (no more airplane mode problems)

#### TESTING
* write unit tests for the controller
* style the bastard

#### MYH
* supply actual images from MYH (use images uploaded to my S3 account)
* figure out how to host it within myh airspace (ask dev ops?)

#### Features
* add a timer? keep track of points using that as well
* log keystrokes? measure accuracy? 
* swap out flash messages for something sexy

#### Bugs
* Figure out why gulp needs a double tap on the save command to get styles to show up in the browser
